                        This shoe is a fun and peppy daily training shoe. Saucony made a few small changes from the previous iteration of this 
                        shoe. The most notable changes come in the upper which is lighter weight and slightly more breathable. 
                        The midsole of this shoe is made from Saucony’s PWRRUN+ Pbex foam. This foam is both light weight, durable, and quite 
                        responsive, which is quite the feet to be able to tick all three of those boxes. The upper is made from mono-mesh low 
                        density material that is quite breathable and with the slight overlays that the have added it makes for a durable and 
                        reliable upper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fit of this shoe is quite impressive and worthy of note. The upper is a near perfect hit, hugging all the right 
                        places but allowing the foot plenty of space to breath and expand as you hit the roads. The heel counter is quite rigid 
                        but stuffed full of foam with helps provide optimal lock down and control. A complaint that some reviewers had was the 
                        combination of semi-stretchy laces and a highly cushioned tongue. Some found it hard to adjust the laces and get the 
                        right pressure. This is not something that I found to be the case for me.
                    </p>

                        I personally found this shoe to be a work horse. A great daily trainer that was capable of some upper tempo efforts 
                        as well as some light trail running. I found the shoe to be a near perfect balance of soft/plush cushioning and 
                        responsive running. It made for a delightful running experience. I found the shoe to be much better than the previous 
                        version. I feel like it’s a shoe that will stand the test of time and be able to withstand 400-600 miles fairly easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary use case for this shoe will be daily training and long runs. I feel that the shoe really excels in those 
                        two categories. Its and acceptable shoe for some tempo efforts and longer repeats but there are better options for 
                        that style of workout. I would only ever grab this shoe for a tempo if I was on vacation and didn’t have my regular 
                        workout shoes with me.

                        This shoe is an impressive upgrade to a shoe that was already so well built. This years edition of the triumph is a true master class in what 
                        it is to produce an everyday trainer that is fun to run in day after day. With this 20th edition Saucony overhauled their already popular shoe
                         by redesigning the upper to be much lighter and the midsole to be plush and responsive. This redesign feels so much like the Saucony Endorphin
                          Speed and Endorphin Pro that I almost don’t believe I’m not running in one of Saucony’s premium racing shoes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The upper fits much the same as previous iterations of the shoe but cuts down on the thickness of the material allowing it to be more breathable.
                         The one complaint I’ve had with this version is it feels like the laces are too short in length, making it difficult to tie, especially 
                         if you’re mid-run and tired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The outer sticks to the same pattern of rubber and exposed foam familiar to fans of the Saucony line up. It is surprisingly grippy in wet 
                        conditions and quite durable. My current pair have 200 miles and the tread still look practically brand new. I’ve run on rocky/muddy trails 
                        and many road miles and the shoe still looks amazing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The midsole is the true miracle here. Saucony introduced the same foam that they use in the Endorphin line up and it works wonders here.
                         The foam is so soft and luxurious to run in while being incredibly responsive. The shoe threads the needle of being a daily trainer/long 
                         run shoe and a workout shoe. I would have no issues grabbing this shoe and going out for a long tempo. This shoe has amazing energy return!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="triumph20-recs">
                    <p>
                        Up to this point the durability has been amazing. With this midsole material it does make me wonder how long the magic will last. I have 200 
                        miles in my pair with no sign of wear and tear but the foam has to begin to break down at some point. I would be comfortable saying this shoe 
                        will easily do 400 miles and beyond but the magic will probably begin to fade somewhere before 500 miles if I had to guess.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said I would recommend this shoe to anyone. The durability is high enough to last and shoe seems to be capable of handling 
                        almost anything I can throw at it. I would say that its primary use is probably in a daily trainer and long run shoe. It wouldn’t be my first 
                        choice of workout shoe with the likes of the Nike Vaporfly available. That said this shoe is perfectly capable and would do quite well in a 
                        workout. So if you’re on somewhat of a budget or just don’t like the fit of Nike this would be a great choice as a one stop shop!

                    <p>
                        Saucony has been on a tear the last few years, and this shoe captured lightning in a bottle. This shoe captures the fever dream of the weekend
                         warrior and makes them feel like its possible. They make it feel like you really can take on the world and you might just finally have that 
                         break through you’ve been waiting for. Lacing up in a pair of the Endorphin Speed shoe just feels fast. The upper is very light weight and
                          breath able. The heel cup is ridged with enough foam on it that it hugs your heel and locks you down. The laces are light weight and thin 
                          but have enough grip and bite to them that they stay tied and locked down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I’ve gotten that out of my system lets get into the details. The upper is made from a thin mono-mesh with lots of perforations. 
                        The toe box is a bit roomier than the first iteration making it more accessible to a wider range of runners. The heel counter has a bit more 
                        cushion to it than the first iteration of the Endorphin Speed, which allows the shoe to be a bit more forgiving and comfortable. The shoe fits 
                        pretty true to size, if you had to size up with the previous version I’d recommend your regular size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The midsole is a delight. It is made with  PWRRUN PB foam. It’s a peba based foam. It’s fairly dense but still provides a very resilient, 
                        responsive ride. The foam combined with the shape of the shoe really combine to propel you forward. The shoe has a full length nylon plate. 
                        The nylon plate helps with stability and energy return and is more forgiving than a carbon fiber plate. In my  opinion it provides a much better
                         ride than the carbon plate used in the Endorphin Pro. This shoe is a joy to run in. When I put them on I know its shoe time and that I’ll run 
                         fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>The shoe does seem to be quite durable. I would say that for a plated race shoe its on the more durable side. I would say this shoe should and 
                        will feel amazing for 300-400 miles. I think if you use it like me and run trails in them, then a little bit less like 250-300 miles. 
                        Which is probably my only complaint with the shoe, is that it isn’t indestructible.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="endorphin-recs">
                    <p>
                        That being said I would only recommend it for workouts or races. It is often advertised as a daily trainer but I feel that the geometry of the
                         shoe combined with the foam and nylon plate make it hard to truly run slow enough on easy run days. This shoe is my go to long repeat and tempo
                         run shoe. I wouldn’t choose it for road races, simply because the Endorphin Pro or the Vaporfly are better options, but it is my go to trail
                         race shoe. This shoe is not a trail shoe and some people might be outraged by that suggestions, but I love this shoe for trail races that 
                         take place on well groomed trails, its stable enough that I feel comfortable bombing descent and taking corners and has the cushion to protect
                         against the rocks. I wouldn’t use it on technical trails or wet trails, but it rips dry groomed trails.
