        Hey there! I'm Danny Ellis. I'm studying Applied Technology.
        I currently work at a law firm in Indepence, Missouri as an IT Tech.
        A large part of my job is managing our website, so this course will
        help a lot with that. I am going back to school to pursue and old dream
        of being a software engineer. I am also intrested in Game Development. I am
        currently making a game in python that combines traditional snake and portals
        like the Portals video-game.

        I have been a member of the chruch my whole life. I served a mission
        in Ecuador from 2016-2018. It was an amazing experience. I still love
        speaking spanish and will read/listen to Harry Potter in spanish every
        year. One of the most important things I learned on my mission is that
        with the help of the Lord I can do all things.
