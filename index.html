          <p class="profile-info">I love to run, ski, and rock climb. I am passionate about coding and
            developing systems to make the end user experience better! I love approaching each problem in a unique way
            and looking for ways that I can simplify the problem by implementing some code. I bring a variety of technical
            skills to the table including: Python, HTML, CSS and API implementation.

            <h3 class="skill-title">Software Development</h3>
            <p class="skill-info">As a software developer, I love looking for ways to develop software that will make life easier. At my current job we handle hundreds of 
                thousands of PDF files many of which are scanned in and not searchable. I discovered that the attorneys secretaries would ofter spend hours 
                browsing PDFs looking for a particular form or file. I developed a software that scans each new PDF saved to the network drive and convert 
                each scanned PDF into a searchable PDF, saving the secretaries hours each day.

            <p class="skill-info" id="stopwatch-info">One of the skills I'm most proud of is process improvement and optimization. I love being able to track how long a task took 
                and finding ways to cut that time down. As the Senior Production Manager at Patrick Adair Designs I was able to implement changes 
                to the company production processes that improved ring production by 300%. I love making life simpler and more efficient, and as a programmer
                I am more empowered to do so.

            <p class="skill-info">I am crazy person that likes hanging off the side of cliffs. I love being outside and spending time with friends as we caress some rock.
                Rock climbing is an amazing workout for body and mind. Each climb is its own unique puzzle that must be solved to get to the top. I love
                climbing with friends and seeing the different ways that we approach each climb and its unique challenges. I love watching as someones face
                lights up as they solve a particularly challenging section of the climb.
