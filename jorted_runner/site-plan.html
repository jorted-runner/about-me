        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This will include a small running resume of sorts. I want it to start by introducing how I began running. 
        I’ll tell the story of how the girl I had a crush on invited me to run cross country with her the summer before we started high school. 
        We both showed up to practice the first day and we both hated it. She quit that day, but my parents wouldn’t let me saying that I had committed and had to at least finish out this school year. 
        That year I learned to love running and haven’t ever looked back. Id then talk a little about continuing running after high school and as an adult. 
        Fitting it in to my life despite having a full-time job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing that I will talk about is my love of running shoes. I’ll talk about working at a running specialty store and how the majority of my paychecks were spent buying new shoes. 
        At my peak my closet had more that 50 pairs of running shoes, I’ve since had to cut it down to a more realistic 8 pairs
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of this will include my love of trail running and what drew me to run trail and ultra-marathon distance races. 
        I will talk about my love of exploration and discovery and how running trail helped me fulfill those desires. 
        As I have transitioned to a more serious adult full time job I’ve had to shift away from trail running but I’m still able to scratch the itch to explore and discovery by tracking the percentage of my city I’ve run and pushing myself to run roads and routes that I’ve never run down. 
        Often this will look like me running through a sub division and turning down every street until I find where it ends or rejoins a road that I’ve run before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll also include some of my PRs, because I feel like it adds a little bit of validity to my opinions.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="images/jorted_runners.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
      </ul>
      <h3>Shoe Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        The second page will be for shoe reviews. I will include my initial thoughts on a shoe based upon appearance, style, and fit. I will then include some stats about the shoes, such as weight, stack height, type of foams, and type of upper material.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following paragraph will include my thoughts and recommended usage after running the shoe for 50 or more miles. I’ll talk about how the shoe felt under foot, ground feel, rebound, energy return, durability and fit. I will also give the shoe a score out of ten in those same categories and then the overall score will be an average of those ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d also like each shoe review to include an affiliate link to the shoe. This might have to come later, but I think that it would be nice to have a way to make a small amount of money off of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shoes I will be reviewing initially:
        Saucony Triumph 19,
        Saucony Triumph 20,
        Saucony Endorphin Speed 2,
        Nike Vaporfly,
        Nike Alpafly,
        and New Balance More Trail 2.

      </ul>
      <h3>Race Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be for race reviews. I will give a brief synopsis of my experience at the race as well as a screen shot of my Strava stats for that race and any pictures that I have from the event. I will then give my thoughts on how the race was and if I’d recommend the race to other runners. I will rate the race in a few categories: Organization, Aid-Stations, quality of the course, if it’s a trail race I’ll rate it on creativity of the route, and over all experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Races I’ll be reviewing:
        Utah Valley Marathon,
        Cold Water Rumble 100 Miler,
        Squaw Peak 50 Miler,
        Corner Canyon 50k,
        and Bear Trap 15 Miler.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Race Reviews</h3>
      <p>         
        On this page the idea is to have boxes with an image from the race and the race name and when you click on them, 
        it expands to fill most of the page. THe background will fade but still be visable.
