                My name is Danny Ellis, or the Jorted Runner. I often find myself running through the mountains and streets in a short 
                pair of Daisy Duke Jorts. I wasn’t always this scantily clad runner but have slowly progressed… or regressed… to this point 
                in my life.
                <br>
                I started running when I was starting high school in 2011. I was an awkward semi-athletic 14 year old with a massive crush on 
                Rebekah, so naturally when she called me one summer evening and asked if I was going to cross-country the next day I told her 
                that I would be there. This was my first mistake was agreeing to show up at all. When I showed up at cross-country practice I 
                remember being awed and somewhat scared of the older boys that were wearing their tiny shorts and nothing else. Rebekah and I 
                ran the first like quarter mile together and then she began to walk, I wasn’t a prodigy runner, but I kept running, wanting to 
                show off how fast and fit I was. I didn’t make it much further before I began walking. After that practice we both agreed that we 
                were done, it was awful! We both hated running so much! And that was indeed her last cross-country practice, but it was not mine. 
                When I told my parents I wanted to quit they told me I couldn’t, I had to at least finish this season.
                <br>
                By the end of the season, I had learned to love running! I was no where near fast at that point but I was hooked. I would keep 
                running every track and cross country season until I graduated in 2015. After graduating I served an LDS mission in Guayaquil, 
                Ecuador where I would convince most of my companions to brave the dogs and run with me every morning. I loved it!
                <br>
                When I got home from my mission in February of 2018 I began running again and listening to audio books about these crazy things 
                called Ultra Marathons. I began running quite a bit and signed up for a trail series that included a trail half-marathon, a 16 
                mile race to the peak at Park City Ski Resort, and then a full trail marathon. During training for that I also signed up for a 
                half marathon in Heber where I lived. It started 13 miles up in the mountains and descended nearly 4000 feet back into town. 
                I being inspired by the crazy people in my audio books decided to wake up at 3:30 am and run to the start and then run the race, 
                and it was a blast!

                That summer really cemented my love for long distance running and trail running in particular. I the signed up for the Squaw Peak
                50-mile trail race followed a few months later by the Corner Canyon 50k in Draper Utah. After those events I set my eyes on 
                something that seems impossible, a 100 Miler. I set my eyes the Coldwater Rumble 100 miler in January of 2020. After a full summer
                of training and preparing the day came and I was able to complete the 100 mile distance and I was able to finish top 10. 
                It was amazing! I was so proud of my accomplishment!
                <br>
                After the 100 mile race I took several months off and I recovered and adjusted to life in the midst of the pandemic. 
                After taking 3 or 4 months off running I began to get the itch again and decided to see how fast I could run a marathon on the 
                roads. I chose to run the Utah Valley Marathon in 2021. It went very well, I ran much faster than I could have hoped and felt 
                fantastic. Since that marathon I have run on and off but I haven’t found a race that really makes me want to push myself that 
                same way, but as of December 2022 I have begun training again and we’ll see what catches my eye and gets me to go to crazy places
                again.
